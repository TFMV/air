# Apache Airflow: Task Groups and Pools Examples

This repository contains example DAGs and documentation for a Medium article, namely:

1. How to organize tasks using Task Groups for better clarity and maintainability
2. How to implement Pools for resource management and rate limiting
3. How to combine both patterns for optimal workflow execution

## Repository Structure

```bash
air/
├── dags/
│   ├── combined_example.py    # Demonstrates using both Task Groups and Pools
│   ├── pool_example.py        # Shows Pool implementation for API rate limiting
│   └── task_group_example.py  # Illustrates Task Group usage
```

## Key Concepts

### Task Groups

- Organize related tasks into logical units
- Improve DAG readability and maintainability
- Enable parallel processing within groups
- Simplify dependency management

### Pools

- Control concurrent task execution
- Manage resource constraints
- Implement rate limiting
- Prevent system overload

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Ensure you have Apache Airflow installed
3. Copy the DAG files to your Airflow DAGs folder
4. Create the required pools using the Airflow UI or CLI:

   ```bash
   airflow pools set database_pool 2 "Limits concurrent database operations"
   airflow pools set api_rate_limit_pool 2 "Limits concurrent API calls"
   ```

## Examples

### Combined Example

The `combined_example.py` DAG demonstrates:

- Parallel data processing using Task Groups
- Database updates with Pool rate limiting
- Pool existence verification
- Proper error handling and logging

### Pool Example

The `pool_example.py` DAG shows:

- API rate limiting using Pools
- Pool verification before execution
- Sequential task execution with pool constraints

### Task Group Example

The `task_group_example.py` DAG illustrates:

- Task organization using Task Groups
- Parallel processing within groups
- Clear dependency management

## Best Practices

1. **Task Groups**
   - Use clear, descriptive names
   - Keep groups focused and logical
   - Avoid unnecessary nesting
   - Document group purposes

2. **Pools**
   - Verify pool existence before use
   - Set appropriate slot limits
   - Monitor pool usage
   - Document pool configurations

3. **Combined Usage**
   - Separate concerns appropriately
   - Monitor resource usage
   - Document design decisions
   - Implement proper error handling
